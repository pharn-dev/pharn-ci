# Policy keys, rules and default levels (pharn-ci 0.4.x to 0.9.x)

Source: pharn-ci v0.4.0 at commit `a9314e9fda1ae220e42fa0d7e6ff5c0a04e1d756` and
v0.9.1 at `dec4a0ed2d0b111233522753909c74a90b6d09e0`: `schema/policy.v1.json`
(the bundled `scripts/policy.v1.json` is a byte copy of v0.9.1's), README ("Org
policy", "P13", "P14", "Prompt-injection scan", "Dependency safety", "Flaky
tests and JUnit results", "Config"), CHANGELOG and `docs/LIMITS.md`. pharn-ci
0.1.x to 0.3.x read no policy. The schema closes every object
(`additionalProperties: false`), bounds every list at 1000 items and every
string, and requires only `version`.

A policy document is JSON. The smallest valid one is `{ "version": 1 }`. A key
left out sets nothing.

After 0.4.0 the schema gained two keys, `dependencies.lookup` (0.8.0) and the
`injection` object (0.7.0). Some keys the 0.4.0 schema already accepted are
applied from later releases: `policy.rules.P13`, `policy.rules.P14`,
`agents.max_files` and `agents.max_changed_lines` from 0.6.0, and
`flaky.quarantine` and the other `dependencies` keys from 0.8.0. A policy
written with them is validated by every 0.4.x and later release, and applied
only by the release that reads them.

## Rules and their default levels

Each line names a rule, the policy keys that feed it and its default level.
`policy.rules` sets a rule's severity (`block`, `warn`, `info` or `off`); a
`block` finding is an `error` message and fails the check.

- P01, required agent setup, fed by `setup.require` and `setup.expect`: `error` by default (the codes `NO_AGENT_SETUP_FILES` and `AGENT_SETUP_EXPECTED_MISSING`).
- P02, forbidden permission allowed, fed by `setup.forbidden_permissions`: `error` by default (`warn` for `additionalDirectories`); also flags `defaultMode` `bypassPermissions` or `auto`.
- P03, required deny rule missing, fed by `setup.required_permissions_deny`: `error` by default.
- P04, MCP server not allowlisted, fed by `setup.allowed_mcp_servers`: `error` by default.
- P05, forbidden MCP server, fed by `setup.forbidden_mcp_servers`: `error` by default.
- P06, required hook missing, fed by `setup.required_hooks`: `error` by default.
- P07, agent instruction files disagree, fed by `setup.consistency`: `warn` by default.
- P08, forbidden file tracked, fed by `setup.forbidden_files`: `error` by default.
- P09, the pull request loosens what it is graded by (the policy file, the config, a workflow or an agent settings file): `error`, `warn` or `info` by what changed; no key feeds it.
- P10, policy unavailable, fed by `policy.required`: `warn` by default, `error` with `policy: required` or `policy.required: true`; its severity cannot be overridden.
- P11, agent PR changes a protected path, fed by `agents.protected_paths` and `agents.protected_paths_mode`: `error` by default (`block`).
- P12, meant for `agents.require_human_approval`: not enforced in 0.4.x to 0.9.x; no finding, no level.
- P13, agent self-modification (0.6.0): an agent pull request widens what an agent may do in an agent settings file, an MCP config, a workflow or CODEOWNERS. No key feeds it; it runs under any app or `file:` policy. `error` by default; an app policy can set `policy.rules.P13`, a `file:` policy cannot lower it.
- P14, agent PR size cap (0.6.0), fed by `agents.max_files` and `agents.max_changed_lines`: `error` by default, and off until the policy sets a cap (there is no default cap).

The prompt-injection signals PI01 to PI05 (`injection.signals`) and the
test-integrity signals TI01 to TI16 (`test_integrity.signals`) have their own
severities. The dependency signals D01 to D05 have no policy severity: D01, D04
and D05 always block and D02 and D03 always warn.

## Top-level keys

`version`, `coverage`, `setup`, `test_integrity`, `flaky`, `policy`, `agents`,
`dependencies` and, from 0.7.0, `injection` are the only top-level keys the
schema accepts.

### `version` (required)

The number `1`. Not merged: every layer carries the same version.

### `coverage`

Feeds the diff coverage gate (no P rule).

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | ------- |
| `coverage.threshold` | Minimum diff coverage percent, 0 to 100. The larger of the policy's and the repository's value applies. |
| `coverage.exclude` | Globs of files left out of diff coverage. A served policy replaces the repository's list. Not allowed from a `file:` policy. |
| `coverage.root` | Directory relative coverage paths start from, or `null` for the repository root. Not allowed from a `file:` policy. |

### `setup`

Agent setup rules, P01 to P08.

| Key | Feeds | Meaning |
| --- | ----- | ------- |
| `setup.require` | P01 | `true` requires at least one agent setup file; `true` wins over a repository's `false`. |
| `setup.expect` | P01 | Agent tools whose setup files must exist, from the fixed list of tool names (`claude-code`, `cursor`, `copilot`, `codex`, `gemini`, `mcp`, ...); added to the repository's own. |
| `setup.consistency` | P07 | Severity of contradictory instruction files. |
| `setup.forbidden_permissions` | P02 | Permission rules (`Tool` or `Tool(pattern)`) a settings file's `allow` list must not equal, widen or contain. |
| `setup.required_permissions_deny` | P03 | Permission rules that every settings directory must deny, or deny more broadly. |
| `setup.allowed_mcp_servers` | P04 | MCP server names that are allowed. An empty list means any server, so it restricts nothing. |
| `setup.forbidden_mcp_servers` | P05 | MCP server names or command globs that must not be configured. |
| `setup.required_hooks` | P06 | Hooks that must exist, each `{ "event": "PreToolUse", "matcher": "Bash" }` (`event` letters only, `matcher` optional). |
| `setup.forbidden_files` | P08 | Globs of files that must not be tracked. |

### `test_integrity`

Feeds the test-integrity signals TI01 to TI16 (the gate, no P rule).

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | ------- |
| `test_integrity.mode` | `block`, `warn` or `off`. The policy can raise the mode above the workflow input and the config (`block > warn > off`). |
| `test_integrity.signals` | A severity (`block`, `warn`, `info` or `off`) per signal id `TI01` to `TI16`; any other key, `TI17` included, is an error. |
| `test_integrity.accept_label` | The label that signs off test-integrity blocks. Only an app policy may set it; a `file:` policy may not, and `.pharn/ci.yml` never. |

### `flaky`

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | ------- |
| `flaky.quarantine` | From 0.8.0: whether the pharn.dev app's quarantine list applies to the JUnit results (`junit-paths`). The list is applied unless the policy sets `false`; it comes only from the app's own policy response, never from a policy document or a pull request. Test results never change the verdict either way. In 0.4.x to 0.7.x it is accepted and not applied. |

The app's policy response also carries settings that are not keys of this
document, such as `settings.uploadJunit` (`false` keeps the JUnit results out of
a run upload) and `settings.messageMaxBytes`. They are set in the pharn.dev app;
the checker does not know them, and a document that names them fails it.

### `policy`

Policy mode settings and rule severities.

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | ------- |
| `policy.required` | `true` makes an unavailable policy block the check (P10). Not allowed from a `file:` policy. |
| `policy.rules` | A severity per rule id `P01` to `P14`. Applied to P01 to P09 and P11 from 0.4.0, and to P13 and P14 from 0.6.0; P10 cannot be overridden, and P12 is accepted and not enforced. |

### `agents`

Agent pull request detection and rules.

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | ------- |
| `agents.labels` | Extra PR labels that mark an agent PR (added to `agent` and `ai-generated`). |
| `agents.extra_logins` | Extra GitHub logins whose PRs are agent PRs (a trailing `[bot]` is allowed). |
| `agents.protected_paths` | Globs an agent PR must not change (P11). A path that matches is one violation; a rename counts by both its old and new path. |
| `agents.protected_paths_mode` | `block` (the default) or `warn`; the stricter of it and `policy.rules.P11` applies. |
| `agents.max_files` | From 0.6.0, P14: most files an agent PR may change, 1 to 100000. A rename counts once; lockfiles, snapshots, `*.generated.*` files and `coverage.exclude` paths do not count (they do when the PR edits the config or a workflow, unless the exclusions are the app policy's). |
| `agents.max_changed_lines` | From 0.6.0, P14: most changed lines (added plus removed) an agent PR may have, 1 to 10000000, counted the same way. |
| `agents.require_human_approval` | Accepted by the schema, not enforced: it is meant for rule P12, which 0.4.x to 0.9.x do not apply. |

For a cap the smaller limit wins: a `file:` policy the pull request edits applies
the smaller of its merge-base and head values for each cap, so it can lower a
cap but never raise or remove one. There is no default cap: set one to turn P14
on.

### `dependencies`

Dependency safety (D01 to D05). From 0.8.0, an app policy with a
`dependencies` key requires the check: a `never` input becomes `auto`, named in
`POLICY_OVERRIDE_IGNORED`.

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | ------- |
| `dependencies.lookup` | From 0.8.0: `true` turns on the registry lookups (D01 to D03) in the Action, whatever the `dependencies` input says. Booleans, `true` wins. |
| `dependencies.registries` | The ecosystems (`npm`, `pypi`) whose added packages are looked up; a served policy narrows them. Each maps to a fixed host list in the Action, so a policy never names a host. It does not add an allowed host for D05: a private registry stays D05. Not allowed from a `file:` policy. |
| `dependencies.min_age_days` | D02: minimum age in days of an added package, 0 to 3650 (default 30). A served policy replaces the default; lower layers can still raise it. |
| `dependencies.min_weekly_downloads` | D03: minimum weekly npm downloads of an added unscoped package, 0 to 1000000000 (default 100). Same merge as `dependencies.min_age_days`. |

### `injection`

From 0.7.0: the prompt-injection scan of the lines a pull request adds. The scan
runs without this key, with PI01 at `block` and PI02 to PI05 at `warn`.

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | ------- |
| `injection.exempt` | Globs of files no PI signal reads, added to the built-in exemptions (fixtures, test data, test files). Applied from an app policy only: a `file:` policy's exemptions are never applied (`POLICY_OVERRIDE_IGNORED`). |
| `injection.phrases` | Extra phrases (names, matched case-insensitively with white space folded) that PI03 reports in added lines and PI02 in hidden Markdown; a finding names a `PX` id, never the phrase. A `file:` policy's list is united with its merge-base list. |
| `injection.signals` | A severity (`block`, `warn`, `info` or `off`) per signal id `PI01` to `PI05`; any other key is an error. An app policy replaces the default; a `file:` policy can only raise it. |

Each signal has its own key, `injection.signals.PI01` (invisible or
bidirectional Unicode, default `block`) to `injection.signals.PI05` (an
instruction file added inside a vendored directory, default `warn`). An
exemption or an `off` hides findings for every repository the policy covers:
draft them only when the person asks for that specific entry.

## `.pharn/ci.yml` and the workflow inputs may only tighten

A policy is applied over the workflow inputs and `.pharn/ci.yml`. Underneath
it, since 0.6.0, `.pharn/ci.yml` may only tighten the coverage threshold
(`coverage.threshold`: with an input set too, the larger applies), `setup.require`
(`true` stays on when the `require-agent-setup` input is `false`) and the
test-integrity mode (`test_integrity.mode` applies only when it is stricter than
the `test-integrity` input), because the pull request carries the file. An input
still replaces the config's coverage file, root and format, and
`coverage.exclude` is the config's patterns plus the input's.

From 0.8.0 the same holds for dependency safety: `dependencies.lookup` set to
`true` in `.pharn/ci.yml` turns lookups on over the `auto` input but never
overrules a workflow's `dependencies: never`, and its `min_age_days` and
`min_weekly_downloads` only raise the defaults.

A `file:` policy is carried by the pull request too, so it can only raise: a
higher threshold, `setup.require: true`, a stricter mode, more `setup.expect`
tools, higher signal severities, more injection phrases and lower P14 caps.
Exclusions, a root, an accept label, `policy.required`, `injection.exempt` and
`dependencies.registries` are not allowed from a file.

## Writing the values

- A glob (`coverage.exclude`, `setup.forbidden_files`, `agents.protected_paths`,
  `injection.exempt`) is repository-relative with `*`, `**` and `?` only: no
  leading `./`, `/` or `!`, no trailing `/`, no `//`, no `..` segment and none
  of `\ { } [ ]`.
- A permission rule is `Tool` or `Tool(pattern)`. In a rule `/x` is relative to
  the settings file's project directory and `//x` is absolute, so the system
  `/etc` is `Edit(//etc/**)`.
- A `root` is a normalized repository-relative directory (`.` is the root), not
  absolute, with no `..` segment.
- A login is a GitHub login of at most 39 characters, optionally followed by
  `[bot]`; a label is at most 50 characters.
- Rules are compared with rules, never with what a command does:
  P02 to P06 are text guards, not a security boundary. `Bash(curl:*)` denied
  does not stop `/usr/bin/curl` or `sh -c`; sandboxing is the boundary.
- `agents.protected_paths` can block Dependabot and Renovate, which count as
  agent PRs: do not protect files those bots must update. The same holds for
  P14 caps: a large Dependabot pull request counts.
